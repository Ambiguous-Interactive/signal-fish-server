# Validates GitHub Actions workflow files for syntax errors, best practices,
# and common mistakes using actionlint. This ensures workflow quality and helps
# catch issues before they cause CI/CD failures.
#
# Runs on:
# - Push to main branch (when workflow files change)
# - Pull requests to main (when workflow files change)
# - Weekly schedule (Monday at 00:00 UTC) for proactive validation
#
# Features:
# - Path filtering to only run when workflow/action files change
# - Uploads actionlint results as artifacts for review
# - Enforces timeout to prevent hanging jobs
# - Automatic cancellation of stale runs via concurrency groups
