# Typos configuration for signal-fish-server
#
# This file configures the typos spell checker to recognize:
# - Rust crate names (dependencies from Cargo.toml)
# - Technical terminology specific to game networking and WebSockets
# - Common abbreviations and domain-specific jargon
# - Project-specific identifiers and conventions
#
# Organization:
# - Files to exclude from checking
# - Technical terms organized by category (alphabetically within sections)
# - Code identifiers that are intentionally abbreviated
#
# See: https://github.com/crate-ci/typos
