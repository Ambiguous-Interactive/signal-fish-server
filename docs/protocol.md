# Protocol Reference

Signal Fish Server uses a JSON-based WebSocket protocol. All messages are JSON objects with a `type` field and
optional `data` field.

MessagePack encoding is also supported for game data when `enable_message_pack_game_data` is enabled.

## Client Messages

### Authenticate

Authenticate with app credentials (required when auth is enabled). App ID is a public identifier that identifies
the game application.

```json
{
  "type": "Authenticate",
  "data": {
    "app_id": "my-game"
  }
}

```

Optional fields:

- `sdk_version` - SDK version for debugging and analytics
- `platform` - Platform information (e.g., "unity", "godot", "unreal")
- `game_data_format` - Preferred game data encoding (defaults to JSON text frames)

### JoinRoom

Join or create a room for a specific game. If no `room_code` is provided, a new room will be created.

```json

{
  "type": "JoinRoom",
  "data": {
    "game_name": "my-game",
    "player_name": "Player1"
  }
}

```

Required fields:

- `game_name` - Name of the game
- `player_name` - Name for the player

Optional fields:

- `room_code` - Code of existing room to join (if not provided, creates new room)
- `max_players` - Maximum players for the room (only used when creating new room)
- `supports_authority` - Whether the room supports authority system (only used when creating new room)
- `relay_transport` - Preferred relay transport protocol (TCP, UDP, or Auto)

### GameData

Send arbitrary game data to other players in the room.

```json

{
  "type": "GameData",
  "data": {
    "data": {
      "action": "move",
      "x": 100,
      "y": 200
    }
  }
}

```

The outer `data` is the serde content tag. The inner `data` is the variant
field and can be any JSON-serializable object.

### PlayerReady

Signal readiness to start the game in lobby. Drives lobby state transitions.

```json

{
  "type": "PlayerReady"
}

```

This message has no data payload.

### AuthorityRequest

Request or release game authority.

```json

{
  "type": "AuthorityRequest",
  "data": {

  |--- LeaveRoom --------------------->|
  |<-- RoomLeft -----------------------|

```

## Reconnection Flow

When a client disconnects, the server generates a reconnection token bound to
the player's ID and room. The client uses this token along with the `player_id`
and `room_id` (from the original `RoomJoined` response) to reconnect:

```json

{
  "type": "Reconnect",
  "data": {
    "player_id": "your-player-id",
    "room_id": "your-room-id",
    "auth_token": "stored-token"
  }
}

```

On successful reconnection, the server sends a `Reconnected` message with the current room state and any
missed events that occurred during the disconnection.
